HDFS
----

   1.Hadoop Distributed File System
   2.DFS - Data storage Framework
   
Why?
   
    1. It is mainly designed for data analysis
	2. It is duaralbe.
	3. We can't edit/modify the data but we can append the data
	4. We can store input and output for particular job.
	5. It won't support for ACIT
	
	A - Atomicity - If it fail it will return back to orginal transaction
	C - Consisteny - It will distribute the data consistent 
	I - Isolation - Isolation is the separation of resource or data modifications made by different transactions.
	D - Durability - Data's always avaliable
	
	
HDFS Services/Daemons
---------------------
	
	       -Name Node (NN)
		   -Data Node (DN)
		   -Secondary Name Node (SNN)
		   -Stand by Name Node (Standby)
		   
Name Node
---------
	      
		     1. It is master node.
			 2. It will store only meta data. (data about data)
			 3. If NN fails, then whole cluster will be down. -> SPOF(Single point of failure)
			 4. Only one NN avaliable per cluster
			 5. We can call it as main/active NN.
			 6. It will support for Name node high avaliablity(it means if main node fails it will servers backup node)

             FsImage ->Permanent Storage -> Persistence
			 Edits   ->Temp storage (WAL)-> Non Persistence(before commit)
Data Node
---------
 
             1. It is a slave node(here we are storing actual data)
			 2. It will store only actual data
			 3. Totally we can have 4000 machines as DN in hadoop V1. But in Hadoop V2 we can have 35k DN.
			 4. Each DN will send heartbeat(basic information like memory,CPU usage) to NN for every 3 seconds
			 5. If DN is not sending hearbeat to NN for 10 mins, then NN will assume like DN is dead.
			 6. DN - 10TB
			    Block - 128MB
				10TB/128MB 100
			 7. Blocks will separately send block to NN for every 3 secs
			 
Secondary Name Node (SNN) same as Name (checkpoint)
Node structure Same format
perodically sync from main node****** 
---------------------------------------
IF main name node fails it will take backup data from Secondary Name node

              1. It is not backup of NN
			  2. Introduced in Hadoop V2
			  3. Checkpoint node of NN.(it will take previous data as backup)
			                            it will take data backup from active NN between 1 hour interval
			                            it won't take unwanted data
			  4. If main NN fails?
			      new name node comes in picture - > worst case scenario
				  it will get installed or establised immediately it take data backup from SNN
				  (checkpoint) 
			      FsImage ->Permanent Storage -> Persistence
			      Edits   ->Temp storage (WAL)-> Non Persistence(before commit)
			 
		set configurations
        ------------------
        ------------------		
       
	   dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period =1 hour
	   dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns   =1 million
	   
	   
Standby Name Node(Standby)
--------------------------

          1.Introduced in Hadoop V2
		  2.It is backup node if mani NN fails
		   FsImage ->Permanent Storage -> Persistence
		   Edits   ->Temp storage (WAL)-> Non Persistence(before commit)
