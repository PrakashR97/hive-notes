Hive Architecture
-----------------

      1. It is a datawarehouse application
      2. It is developer by facebook
	  3. It stores schema in database(Derby/Mysql/Oracle) and process data in HDFS
	  4. we can process structured, unstructure, semistructured.
	  5. SQL (hql hive-ql), python (pyhive), impala
	  6. It will store data in HDFS and process it through MR(YARN)
	  7. It won't support OLTP
	  
	  
	  
batch process-> processing old data
stream processing -> processing real data 

mapreduce only support-> batch processing only
spark support-> for both stream and batch processing as well
